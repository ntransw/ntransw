        <h4>Shamir's Secret Sharing File Server</h4>
        <div class="desc">
            <ul>
                <li>Utilized technologies: C#, .NET, Git</li>
                <li>Leveraged Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to split a file into smaller encrypted file fragments, or recombine fragments into the original file as needed</li>
