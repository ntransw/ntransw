        <br>
        ● Designed the back-end of an Android app that commands the controllers of a medical device through UDP and Ethernet, using Kotlin's Jetpack Compose framework
        <br>
        ● Collaborated with manufacturing department to create a user-facing device serialization tool with Flask and React, speeding up their production process and eliminating human error by 90%
        <br>
        ● Performed root cause analyses of any automated test failures to resolve bugs while reporting and tracking them on Jira

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <h4>Shamir's Secret Sharing File Server</h4>
        <div class="desc bullet-points">
            ● Utilized technologies: C#, .NET, Git
        <br>
            ● Leveraged Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to split a file into smaller encrypted file fragments, or recombine fragments into the original file as needed
        <br>
            ● Integrated file splitting with automatic uploads to a discord server using the Discord.Net API, bypassing Discord's file size limits and resulting in infinite storage
        <br>
            ● Developed feature that allows user to transmit different file fragments across multiple separate channels, exponentially reducing odds of attacker interception
