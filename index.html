                I am a Software Engineer with 1.5 years of experience, primarily in automated testing for medical devices.
                My passion for technology has also driven me to work on a diverse range of projects, including
                DevOps pipelines, cloud infrastructure, embedded GUIs, and Android applications.
                <br>

                Currently, I've just started working at <a href="https://www.arkhamtechnology.com/">Arkham Technology</a>, a cybersecurity defense contractor!

        <!-- The above whitespace is a quick hack to load the element ASAP without waiting for the data fetch.
             This way, the remainder of the webpage doesn't get visually shifted from a later load. There is probably a better way of doing this.-->

            <ul>
                <li>Developed automation framework using Python and C/C++ to command a medical device through UDP/IP, resulting in a 90% reduction of manual QA and a much faster FDA approval</li>
                <li>Led the design of automated test coverage for a medical device using Python and Pytest, collecting tons of performance data and proving its reliability in satisfying requirements</li>
                <li>Independently set up a CI/CD Jenkins pipeline with Docker, streamlining building, testing, and deployments while reducing build times by 60%</li>
                <li>Implemented embedded GUI for medical device in C/C++ with the Azure RTOS GUIX Studio framework and maintained it based on clinician feedback</li>
                <li>Performed root cause analyses of any automated test failures to fix several bugs while reporting and tracking them on Jira</li>
                <li>Provided mentorship and technical documentation to other juniors/interns for my automation framework, test coverage, and CI/CD pipeline</li>
