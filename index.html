            <p>
                I am a Software Engineer with 1.5 years of experience, primarily in automated testing for medical devices.
                My passion for technology has also driven me to work on a diverse range of projects, including
                DevOps pipelines, cloud infrastructure, embedded GUIs, and Android applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently open to Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and QA Automation Engineer roles.

             This way, the remainder of the webpage doesn't get visually shifted from a later load. There is probably a better way of doing this.-->
